Problem Statement:

Given a string s , find the length of the longest substring t  that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

Example 1:
Input: "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: t is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.


Solution:
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:
        ######## O(N);O(1)
        
        seen={}
        left=0
        mx=0
        for each in range(len(s)):
            if s[each] not in seen:
                if len(seen)==2:
                    mx=max(mx,each-left)
                    remove=min(seen.values())
                    del seen[s[remove]]
                    left=remove+1
                seen[s[each]]=each
            else:
                seen[s[each]]=each
        mx=max(mx,len(s)-left)
        return mx
