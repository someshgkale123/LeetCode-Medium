Problem Statement:

Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Example:
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.

Note:  
1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
n does not exceed 1690.


Solution:
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        li=set({1})
        cnt=1
        while cnt!=n:
            mini=min(li)
            li.remove(mini)
            li.add(mini*2)
            li.add(mini*3)
            li.add(mini*5)
            cnt+=1
        return(min(li))
