Problem Statement:

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). 
We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.

Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not 
allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Example 3:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1

        # This function divides the array into subarrays
        def checkcontainer(mid,weights):
            capacity=0
            days=1
            for each in weights:
                # if subarray capacity is less than mid, add package into subarray
                if capacity+each<=mid:
                    capacity+=each
                
                # else send the package another day
                else:
                    days+=1
                    capacity=each
            return days
        
        # if day==1 then upper bound is sum(weights) and if day is infinite then lower bound is max(weights)
        low=max(weights)
        high=sum(weights)
        while low<high:
            mid=(low+high)//2
            
            # check if current capacity viz. mid can result in D days
            ans=checkcontainer(mid,weights)
            
            # if result if greater than D days, change lower bound to mid+1
            if ans>D:
                low=mid+1
                
            # else change upper bound to mid
            else:
                high=mid
            
        return low
