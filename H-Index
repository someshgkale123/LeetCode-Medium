Problem Statement:

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and 
the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
             
             
Solution:
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        if not citations:
            return 0
        citations.sort(reverse=True)
        print(citations)
        h=0
        for i in range(len(citations)):
            if citations[i]>=i+1:
                h=max(h,i+1)
            else:
                return h
        return h
