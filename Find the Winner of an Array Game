Problem Statement:

Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.
A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]). In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0 and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.
Return the integer which will win the game.
It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:
Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
  1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
  2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1
  3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1
  4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2
So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [3,2,1], k = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,9,8,2,3,7,6,4,5], k = 7
Output: 9

Example 4:
Input: arr = [1,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99], k = 1000000000
Output: 99


Solution:
class Solution:
    def getWinner(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ##### O(N);O(1)
        
        # Initialise max element from array
        mx=max(arr)
        winner=0
        cnt=0
        lastmx=arr[0]
        for i in range(1,len(arr)):
            # if k consecutive wins occur, return winner
            if cnt==k:
                return winner
            
            # get max of lastmax found and current element
            temp=max(lastmx,arr[i])
            
            # if the max element is max of whole array, return mx
            if temp==mx:
                return mx
            
            # if the max element is previous winner, increment win count
            elif temp==winner:
                cnt+=1
            
            # else, current element is new max, initialize the element as winner and set win count 1
            else:
                winner=temp
                cnt=1
            
            # change the lastmx winner
            lastmx=temp
        if cnt==k:
            return temp
