Problem Statement:

You are driving a vehicle that has capacity empty seats initially available for passengers.  The vehicle only drives east (ie. it cannot turn around and drive west.)
Given a list of trips, trip[i] = [num_passengers, start_location, end_location] contains information about the i-th trip: the number of passengers that must be picked up, and the locations to pick them up and drop them off.  The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from your vehicle's initial location.
Return true if and only if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips. 

Example 1:
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,5,7]], capacity = 3
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: trips = [[3,2,7],[3,7,9],[8,3,9]], capacity = 11
Output: true


Solution:
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        
        ####### O(N);O(N)
        
        # get farthest end distance
        end=0
        for i,j,k in trips:
            end=max(k,end)
        
        # initialize route for the trips 
        route=[0]*(end+2)
        
        # for each trip set the passenger counts on the route
        for i,j,k in trips:
            route[j]+=i
            route[k]-=i
        
        # check if paassanger capacity exceeds or not
        for each in range(1,len(route)):
            route[each]+=route[each-1]
            if route[each]>capacity:
                return False
        return True
